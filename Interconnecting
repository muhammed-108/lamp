Step 1 Install PHP.
On the Apache host, run the following command to install PHP:
yum install -y php
After the installation is complete, run the following command to check whether the
installation is correct:
php -v


Step 2 Modify Apache configurations.
Add the PHP configuration to the Apache main configuration file as follows.

AddType appliucaton/x-httpd-php .php

To prevent interference, back up or delete all configurations in the previous labs. For
example, copy all sub-configuration files in conf.d to the new conf.bk directory and
retain only the php.conf file related to PHP.
cd /etc/httpd/conf.d
mkdir conf.bk && mv * conf.bk/
mv conf.bk/php.conf .


Step 3 Verify the configurations.
Create index.php in the root directory of httpd to test whether Apache and PHP can
work properly. The content of index.php is as follows:
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
