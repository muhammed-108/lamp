Step 1 Grant the MySQL access permission.
This lab uses user root for testing. Check whether user root has the required permissions,
as shown in the following figure.

yum install -y mysql
mysql -h'192.168.1.14' -uroot -p'Huawei@123'


Step 2 Install the driver for connecting PHP to MySQL.
Run the following command to install the driver:
yum install -y php-mysqlnd

Step 3 Compile a test file for connecting PHP to MySQL.
Create a conn_mysql.php file in the root directory of httpd and enter the following
content:
<?php
$con = mysqli_connect("192.168.1.14","root","Huawei@123");
if ($con)
 echo 'OK';
else
 echo 'NOT OK';
$con->close();
?>

Enter Apache_host_EIP/conn_mysql.php in the address box of the browser to access the
Apache server and check whether OK is returned.
